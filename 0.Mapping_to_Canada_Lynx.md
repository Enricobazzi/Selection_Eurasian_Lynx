We decided to work with the new Canada Lynx genome (LyCa) as the reference. This means I will have to generate BAM files for all samples aligning the fastq reads to this reference. To speed up the process I will use the FT2 CESGA server. The process will be split into 2 steps:

## Step 1

A script (0.Mapping-executables/LL_CNAG_LyCa_mapping_launcher_cesga.sh) will sbatch a mapping to LyCa script for all elements in a folder which have a BARCODEID correspondent. BARCODEID is a "dictionary" made to have a correspondence between the sample name and the fastq name, as samples sequenced in CNAG have more than one fastq.

Note that I will use some conditions (if statements) in order to run only the samples I need:
```
if [ -f "$FILE" ]
```
to only process the files in the folder of interest, and
```
if [ ${SPECIES} == "ll" ] && [ ${POPULATION} != "ki" ] && [ ${POPULATION} != "po" ] && [ ${POPULATION} != "no" ]
```
to only process lynx lynx samples and avoid repeating the populations that Dani already processed (polonia,noruega,kirov)

It will be run on CNAG fastq folders (LYNX_XX) this way:
```
./LL_CNAG_LyCa_mapping_launcher_cesga.sh <path/to/folder/LYNX_XX/path/to/fastqs>
```
This script will check the above conditions and sbatch another script for the first steps of the mapping process (0.Mapping-executables/LL_CNAG_LyCaRef_mapping_step1_cesga.sh).

## Step 2

Step 2 will consist of just one script that will be sbatched once for each sample (LL_CNAG_LyCaRef_mapping_step2_cesga.sh). This script will take all BAMs from that sample and merge them (if there are 2 or more). Then will complete the rest of the BAM post-processing steps.
```
for sample in $(ls **bams** | get | sample | name)
 do
 sbatch LL_CNAG_LyCaRef_mapping_step2_cesga $sample
done
```
