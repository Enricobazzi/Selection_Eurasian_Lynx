Next step in the pipeline is to filter unwanted variants from the final VCF file.

This are the criteria I will use to filter variants:

(1) Repetitive/Low mappability regions
(2) Indels + Non-biallelic sites
(3) Lynx lynx exclusive substitutions (frequency = 1 in all populations)
(4,5) Hard quality filters, as of GATK standard practices
(6) Under-represented, excessively missing variants
(7) Over/Under covered regions

I will write a script for the first 5 steps which don't require calculations of any filtering thresholds (they are the same no matter the database).
The script is: 2.Variant_filtering-executables/variant_filtering_1to5.sh
```
sbatch variant_filtering_1to5.sh ll_wholegenome_LyCa_ref.sorted
# Submitted batch job 3833293
```



For the last two steps (6 and 7), I will have to write separate script to fine tune my filtering thresholds based on the shape of my data.
